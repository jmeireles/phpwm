basic build instructions... I'll spend more time on this readme as time allows

prerequisites:
-php, compiled with --enable-embed
-php-devel package if your platform requires it
-xcb-devel packages


make clean && make

As phpwm is not quite ready for use as your desktop, the provided runtest.sh will start up an Xephyr session (xnest) and manage windows within that.
